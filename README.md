# R

This repository is where I will store my R code. I am just learning R, so if you see where I can improve my code, please let me know!

I am following the Get R Done tutorial on YouTube by Chad Williams to learn R programming (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Eed0OTZAlI&list=PLmNgrNF3pZqg2GPmcIAWDa1A2-cAfbX37)
Each code file has ~10 episodes of work in it.
